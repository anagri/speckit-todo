# Tasks: Client-Side Todo List Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-we-will-be/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: TypeScript, Next.js v14 (Pages Router), React 18, Tailwind CSS, shadcn UI
   → Storage: Browser Local Storage (client-side only)
   → Testing: React Testing Library, Jest
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Todo, Tag, Category entities
   → contracts/: types.ts, storage-api.ts
   → research.md: Next.js static export, Local Storage strategy, React Context state management
   → quickstart.md: 22 validation scenarios
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Next.js init, dependencies, static export config, shadcn UI setup
   → Tests: Storage tests, component tests, integration tests (TDD)
   → Core: Storage implementation, state management, components
   → Integration: Pages, context providers, data persistence
   → Polish: Deployment, GitHub Actions CI/CD
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Tests before implementation (TDD - constitutional requirement)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Validate: All contracts have tests, all components have tests, TDD enforced
7. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`

- `lib/` - TypeScript utilities and business logic
- `__tests__/` - All test files (mirrors source structure)
- `styles/` - Global CSS and Tailwind config

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies, can run concurrently
- **TDD enforcement**: Every test MUST fail before implementation (constitutional requirement)
- **No if-else/try-catch in tests**: Per user preference, tests must be deterministic
- **data-testid selectors**: Use `getByTestId` for stable test selectors (per user preference)
- **Commit strategy**: After each task completion (but per user preference, manual git commits)
- **Test assertion format**: `assert_eq!(expected, actual)` pattern where applicable
- **console.log in tests**: Only for error scenarios (per user preference)

## Validation Checklist
