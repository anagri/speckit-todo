# Feature Specification: Client-Side Todo List Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-will-be`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "we will be creating a to-do list app. This is a complete client-side project, so the to-dos are going to be stored using the browser's local storage, indexed-db, user can add to-dos, mark it as done, schedule to-dos, give it tags, categories, and priority. Then user can browse, sort, filter to-dos based on these properties."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: Should completed todos remain visible, move to a separate view, or be hidden by default? ‚Üí A: Completed todos are categorized separately in a "completed" category that users can navigate to. This is similar to filtering but specifically for completion status.
- Q: Are there character limits for title and description? ‚Üí A: Title has 512 character limit, description has 5000 character limit.
- Q: Multiple tags per todo or single tag? ‚Üí A: Multiple tags per todo are allowed.
- Q: Multiple categories per todo or single category? Are categories predefined or user-created? ‚Üí A: Single category per todo. Categories are user-created with a flat structure (non-hierarchical).
- Q: What priority levels are available? ‚Üí A: Three levels: Low, Medium, High.
- Q: Date only, or date and time for scheduling? ‚Üí A: Date and time with minute granularity.
- Q: Can multiple sort criteria be applied simultaneously? ‚Üí A: Single sort criterion only.
- Q: Is date/time range filtering a date range picker, or predefined filters? ‚Üí A: Date and time range filtering is possible (custom range selection).
- Q: Should creation date be tracked and sortable? ‚Üí A: Yes, created_at timestamp is recorded when todo is created and never updated. It is sortable.
- Q: Can all properties be edited? ‚Üí A: Yes, any property can be edited.
- Q: Permanent deletion or soft delete with recovery option? ‚Üí A: Soft delete only (todos can be recovered).
- Q: What specific behavior for browser storage limits? ‚Üí A: Do not handle storage limits gracefully. Let the browser throw the error and display it to the user.
- Q: Should tags have colors or icons? ‚Üí A: Tags have pleasant colors. No icons needed.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user visits the todo list application to manage their tasks. They can create new todos with details like title (up to 512 characters), description (up to 5000 characters), due date/time, multiple tags, a single category, and priority level (Low/Medium/High). As they work through their day, they mark tasks as complete. Completed todos move to a "completed" category view that users can navigate to separately. They can organize their view by applying filters and a single sort criterion based on any property to focus on what matters most at any given moment. All data persists locally in their browser, requiring no account or internet connection.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user opens the application for the first time, **When** they view the main page, **Then** they see an empty todo list and a way to create their first todo
2. **Given** the user wants to create a todo, **When** they provide a title (up to 512 chars) and optionally add description (up to 5000 chars), multiple tags with colors, a single category, priority (Low/Medium/High), and schedule date/time with minute precision, **Then** the todo is saved with a created_at timestamp and appears in their list
3. **Given** the user has multiple todos, **When** they mark a todo as done, **Then** the todo's status changes to completed and is accessible via the "completed" category view
4. **Given** the user has todos with various properties, **When** they apply filters for specific tags or categories, **Then** only matching todos are displayed
5. **Given** the user has a filtered list, **When** they apply a sort by priority, due date, or creation date, **Then** the visible todos reorder according to the single selected criterion
6. **Given** the user closes and reopens the browser, **When** they return to the application, **Then** all their previously created todos (including soft-deleted ones) are still present with all their properties intact
7. **Given** the user wants to recover a deleted todo, **When** they access the deleted todos view, **Then** they can restore the todo to active status
8. **Given** the user edits an existing todo, **When** they modify any property (title, description, tags, category, priority, due date/time), **Then** the changes are saved and reflected immediately

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user's browser storage is full and they try to create a new todo? Display the browser's storage error to the user without custom handling.
- How does the system handle todos with past due dates? (Needs visual treatment decision - defer to design phase)
- What happens if the user enters text exceeding the 512 character limit for title or 5000 character limit for description? Prevent input beyond the limit or show validation error.
- Can the user assign multiple tags to a single todo? Yes, multiple tags are allowed.
- Can the user assign multiple categories to a single todo? No, only a single category per todo.
- What happens when the user applies conflicting sort orders? Only one sort criterion can be active at a time; selecting a new criterion replaces the previous one.
- How should the system handle todos without a scheduled date when sorting by date? (Needs sort ordering decision - defer to design phase: should nulls appear first or last?)
- What happens when a user deletes a category that is still assigned to active todos? (Needs decision - defer to design phase)
- Can users delete or rename tags that are assigned to todos? (Needs decision - defer to design phase)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Todo**: Represents a task or item the user wants to track. Core attributes include: unique identifier, title (required, max 512 chars), description (optional, max 5000 chars), completion status (active/completed), soft deletion status (active/deleted), scheduled date and time (minute granularity), tags collection (multiple allowed), category (single, user-created), priority level (Low/Medium/High), created_at timestamp (immutable), updated_at timestamp (modified on edits)
- **Tag**: A label that can be applied to todos for flexible categorization. Attributes: unique name, assigned color (pleasant palette for visual distinction)
- **Category**: A classification for grouping related todos within a flat structure. Attributes: unique name. One category per todo. User-created and managed.
- **Priority**: An enumeration indicating the importance or urgency of a todo. Three levels: Low, Medium, High.
